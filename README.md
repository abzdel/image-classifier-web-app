# Image Classifier Web Service

This is a web application that allows users to upload an image and receive a classification prediction for that image using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application uses Flask as the backend framework, which invokes an AWS Lambda function to make requests to a pre-deployed Amazon SageMaker endpoint for image classification. The predicted labels are then returned to the user and displayed on the web page.
